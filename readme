Controls

It is recommended that you click the blue fullscreen button at the bottom right of the page for the best experience.

How to start a game
Click the "Play" button

How to adjust the maze size
Click the "Options" button on the main menu then use the slider to select a maze size. Larger mazes will take longer to generate.

Know Issues/Bugs
- Agent is not intelligent enough to collect the cubes it is closest to. Instead it collects the cubes in a defined order specifed before the game starts. Collecting a cube that the agent intended to collect can cause its AI to break.
- Game runs poorly on lower end systems
